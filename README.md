Building on Windows with Visual Studio
--------------------------------------
Download and install some version of [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (as of writing, MSVS Community 2019) with **C++ support**.

Also you will need to install [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [ReactPhysics3D](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/).

Start Visual Studio and open .sln file. You can compile the app by right-clicking the project (not the solution) and select "Select as StartUp project". Now you should be able to compile it by clicking the green, triangular "Run" button.
